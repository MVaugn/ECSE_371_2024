## Q1 ##

**How much current flows in the leads of an ideal voltmeter?** _None_  
**How much voltage appears across the leads of an ideal current meter?** _None_  
**A bench power supply contains a voltmeter and an ammeter. Are both these meters accurate when you are interested in accurately measuring the voltage and current at a load that you have connected to the bench power supply with test leads? Elaborate.**  
_The built in voltmeter & ammeter cannot both be accurate. From the answers to the above questions, it is clear that a bench power supply can't be an ideal voltmeter when it is sourcing current, and it can't be an ideal ammeter when it is supplying voltage. Since a bench power supply is doing both under normal operating conditions, both meters inside of a power supply will have some inaccuracy._

**5 four-wire resistance readings for a 0.12 Ohm, 5% resistor:**  
_[1.00000, 2.00000, 3.00000, 4.00000, 5.00000]_

**Which technique is better and why?**
_GREAT QUESTION, LARRY!_
**What is the concept behind four-wire measurement, and what problem does it overcome?**
_GREAT QUESTION, LARRY!_
**Define "precision" and "accuracy"**
_"Precision" is a description of the resolution or exactness of a measurement. In the case of our Hewlett Packard bench DMM, the precision of any measurement is 6 1/2 digits (assuming a stable reading). "Accuracy," on the other hand, describes how close a measurement is to a standardized or agreed-upon "correct" value._

## Q3b ##

**Measure and record the internal resistance of a AA battery:**
_[1.00000, 2.00000, 3.00000, 4.00000, 5.00000]_
**Repeat these measurements for a AAA battery:**
_[1.00000, 2.00000, 3.00000, 4.00000, 5.00000]_
**How do you think the internal resistance of a battery relates to its physical size, output current capability, capacity, and state-of-charge?**
_GREAT QUESTION, LARRY!_

## Q3c ##

**A flashlight with a PR-6 incandescent lamp would use two AA cells in series. However, the PR-6 lamp is rated at 2.47 volts, not 3.0V. Why?**
_As the AA cells source current, their voltage decreases._
